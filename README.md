# Open AI Learning Content Framework (OALCF)

A practical, production-oriented framework for designing **safe, scalable AI-powered learning content platforms**.

This repository focuses on **architecture, patterns, and governance**, not application code.

---

## Why This Framework Exists

As AI-generated content becomes common in education, teams face real-world challenges:

- How do you ensure **age-appropriate, safe content**?
- How do you **evaluate quality** beyond “looks good”?
- How do you roll back or version AI-generated lessons?
- How do you design feedback loops that improve content over time?

OALCF captures **battle-tested design patterns** for these problems.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This is:**
- A reference architecture
- A set of reusable design patterns
- Practical schemas for AI-generated lessons
- Guidance for safety, evaluation, and observability

**This is not:**
- A language-learning app
- A specific curriculum
- A vendor-locked solution

---

## Core Concepts

- AI Content Lifecycle (Generate → Evaluate → Publish → Monitor → Improve)
- Prompt versioning as a first-class artifact
- Built-in safety & moderation layers
- Human-in-the-loop where it matters
- Telemetry-driven improvement

---

## Reference Architecture

See: `architecture/diagrams/system-overview.png`

The framework supports:
- Modular AI services
- Content safety checkpoints
- Evaluation pipelines
- Feedback-driven iteration

---

## Who Is This For?

- AI architects
- EdTech founders
- Platform engineers
- Responsible AI practitioners
- Technical leaders building production AI systems
