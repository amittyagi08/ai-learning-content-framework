# Problem Statement

- AI-generated educational content often lacks consistent quality controls
- Safety and age-appropriateness are frequently handled as afterthoughts
- Prompt changes are rarely versioned or auditable
- Content evaluation is subjective and difficult to automate
- Rollback of incorrect or low-quality AI content is non-trivial
- Feedback from learners is not systematically integrated into content improvement
